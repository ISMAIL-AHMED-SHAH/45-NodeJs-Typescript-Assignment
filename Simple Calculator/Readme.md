My First Ever Mini Project....!
Building a Simple Calculator on TypeScript!

After attending my insightful online class on LinkedIn Zoom, I successfully implemented a simple calculator using TypeScript.

A huge thank you to Sir Zia Khan for generously carving time out of his busy schedule to teach us live. His dedication is truly inspiring!
Major props to the other outstanding instructors, Sir Ameen Alam, Sir Osama, and Sir Faisal Masood Khan, for their unwavering support throughout the class.

By following their clear, step-by-step guidance, we were able to transform theoretical concepts into a functional, 
real-world application â€“ a testament to the effectiveness of their teaching.

This experience has further solidified my understanding of TypeScript and fueled my foundational skills. Onward to the next challenge!

Shoutout to all instructors and mentors
